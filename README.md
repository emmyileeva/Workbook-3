## ðŸ“˜ Exercises Included

### âœ… FamousQuotes
- Stores an array of 10 motivational quotes
- Prompts the user to select a quote by entering a number between 1 and 10

- Bonus features:
  - Option to view a **random quote** by entering 0
  - Prompts the user to continue or exit using a simple loop
- Great practice for:
  - Working with arrays and random selection
  - Using `Scanner` for user input
  - Exception handling with `try-catch`
  - Building simple loops and conditionals for user interaction

### âœ… BedtimeStories
- Loads and reads a text file line-by-line using `Scanner`
- Prompts the user to enter the name of a story file (like `goldilocks.txt`)
- Adds a line number to the beginning of each printed line
- Uses a separate `StoryReader` class to handle the file reading logic
- Includes error handling for file reading issues
- Great practice for:
  - Reading from files with `FileInputStream` and `Scanner`
